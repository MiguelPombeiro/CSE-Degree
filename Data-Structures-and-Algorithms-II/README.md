## How to run

- All three assignments contain a `makefile` that can be used to compile and run the Java code.
- To run the code, navigate to the respective assignment directory and run:
  ```bash
  make run
  ```
- All makefiles expect the input to be provided in a file named `teste-1.in` in the same directory and with the format specified in the respective work statements.
- The output will be generated in a file named `my.out` in the same directory.
