# Computer Graphics

Contains the final projects for the Computer Graphics course. The projects include implementations in various technologies that were covered during the course, such as C2D, SVG, X3D, and 3JS.

## About

The final projects use different technologies to create interactive graphics and visualizations. 
All of them are based on web technologies, allowing them to be run in a web browser:

- **C2D**: A project using the Canvas 2D API to create a 2D scene with a boat and a following object.
- **SVG**: A project using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create a 2D game.
- **X3D**: A project using X3D to create a 3D scene with a ferris wheel.
- **3JS**: A project using Three.js to create a small animation with a given word as the main focus.

## How to run

All projects can be run in the web browser since they are based on web technologies.

To run the projects you must have a local server running the files.

For example, you can use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code or any other local server setup.
